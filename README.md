# Advent of Code 2020

This project contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) challenges. I completed these challenges with Ruby 2.7.1 as a way to freshen up my Ruby knowledge before Ruby 3 is released on Dec. 25th, 2020.

## Running the scripts

Download all of the gem dependencies with `bundle install`.

With Ruby 2.7.1 installed (confirm with `ruby --version`), you should be able to navigate to the exercise you want and the following command. **You will not be able to execute these exercises from the root of the project.**

```
bundle exec ruby main.rb
```

## Styling

This project uses the `standard` gem for linting and auto-formatting. You can auto-format all of the files from the root of the project with the `lint` rake task:

```
bundle exec rake lint
```
